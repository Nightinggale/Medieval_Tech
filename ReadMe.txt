If your game crashes:

If you are getting crashes you can exchange the Assert DLL with the normal one.  Play with this one and you will get potential crash messages. Make note of any messages that appear before a crash. Also, if you games are crashing turn on message logging in the CivilizationIV.ini file located in your My Games/Sid Meier's Civilization Colonization folder. You can then open up your MPlog.txt (in the Logs folder) file and it can help to see what was happening right before the game crashed.

Open CivilizationIV.ini and change the settings below to start logging

Enable the logging system
LoggingEnabled = 1

; Overwrite old network and message logs
OverwriteLogs = 1

; Enable message logging
MessageLog = 1
